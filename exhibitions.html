                <h2>Explore the wonders of Cosmos.</h2>
                <p>Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and
                    know about the universe around us.<br> We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies
                    that
                    can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.<br>
                    Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s
                    telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                <p>Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and
                    understanding our place in this world.<br>
                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved
                    our time.<br> You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive,
                    including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

                <h2>The Great Wonders of the Tiny World</h2>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                    insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                    For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much
                    improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.<br><br> Over a series of
                    exhibits
                    we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the
                    discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.<br>
                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from
                    observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                <h2>The future of our world</h2>
                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important
                    it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans
                    but for the whole planet.<br><br>
                    In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including
                    global warming, extinction of species, and pollution.<br> But we also focus on the positive
                    ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
