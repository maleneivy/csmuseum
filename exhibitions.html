                        <p>Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and
                            know about the universe around us.<br> We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies
                            that
                            can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.<br>
                            Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s
                            telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved
                            our time.<br> You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive,
                            including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

                        <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                            insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much
                            improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.<br><br> Over a series of
                            exhibits
                            we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the
                            discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.<br>
                            Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from
                            observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                            it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans

                            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including

                            ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
